Java 5 to Java 1.4 Source Code Backporting Tool

Is there a tool that, given a Java 5 level source code, will backport it to 
Java 1.4-compliant source code, by removing Generics declarations, 
transforming for eachs in simple fors or iteration fors, etc.

Please note that I am looking for a tool that translates source code to 
source code, not class binaries.
